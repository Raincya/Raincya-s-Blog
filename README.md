# Raincya-s-Blog
## - Description

A **layui-based** implementation of the blog's front-end.

The front-end of this blog uses layui as the base style, and prism is referenced to achieve the code highlighting effect in the article section. During the development process, I implemented a rotating image in the home page and a waterfall effect in the category pages. At the same time, the page display is well compatible with different sizes of devices, which means that the display effect on common devices is different.
